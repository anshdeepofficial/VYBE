## [0.11.7] - 2026-09-04
### Changed
- Converted VYBE to a pure YouTube Music audio experience by removing inline/fullscreen video playback and Videos tabs from Search and Artist profiles.
- Restricted YouTube Music searches to the songs filter so music-video results no longer enter audio result shelves.
- Reordered Accounts to show Linked Services first, followed by Settings & Data Backup.

### Improved
- Parallelized release, trending, and autoplay discovery requests with bounded timeouts for substantially faster Home and Daily Mix refreshes.
- Persisted YouTube Music Library, Liked, Playlist, History, and total synced counts across launches and reconciled them against local synced data.

### Fixed
- Hardened Search list identity for albums with duplicate or missing provider IDs, preventing Compose list-key crashes when Search is opened or refreshed.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-09-04
### Fixed
- **Player Video Button Visibility**:
  - Restricted the video toggle button strictly to genuine music videos (`song.isMusicVideo` or video streams). Standard audio songs no longer display the video icon.
- **Video Buffering & Loading Feedback**:
  - Added an active player buffering listener and loading indicators. While resolving video streams or buffering, a blurred artwork background with a progress spinner and "Loading video..." text is displayed instead of a blank black screen.
- **Fullscreen Video Orientation Glitch**:
  - Eliminated sensor landscape activity flips. The screen remains strictly in portrait/vertical orientation on an edge-to-edge black background with a clean back navigation handler.
- **Dynamic App Logo Light Mode Tinting**:
  - Fixed logo color filtering in `GradientTopBar.kt` and `AboutScreen.kt` to faithfully reflect system Light/Dark theme and appearance preferences.
- **In-App Updater Accurate MB Tracking**:
  - Resolved the "Downloading Unknown from Unknown" issue by providing exact byte counts and automated remote `Content-Length` resolution. Progress displays exact downloaded MBs and total size (e.g. `12.4 MB of 55.0 MB`).
  - Monotonic `versionCode = 11600` ensures seamless in-app and sideload upgrades over version 11500.

### Added
- **Complete 1:1 Parity iOS App (`iosApp`)**:
  - Fully rewritten native SwiftUI iOS companion app matching Android VYBE feature-for-feature: online music streaming, "Best for You" and "Release Radar" home feeds, real-time debounced online search with genre badges, offline cache, and native lock screen media controls.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-09-04
### Fixed
- **In-App Updater Version Code & Monotonic Identity Fix**:
  - Aligned Android release `versionCode` to monotonic identity `11500` across CI and build configurations, resolving the *"Download update is not newer than installed vibe version"* error when installing updates.
  - Hardened updater verification in `GitHubUpdateService` to allow version upgrade when version names are newer even if version codes match.
  - Linked official release signing keys in CI secrets to ensure 100% signature consistency between in-app updates and existing installs.
- **Recommendation Contamination Filter**: Strictly excluded videos and non-original fan remixes (dhol remixes, DJ edits, slowed+reverb, bass boosted, mashups, compilations) from "Recommended for You ✨".
- **Renamed "Trending Now" to "Best for You"**: Tailored discovery tracks to user listening habits with strictly clean audio songs.

### Added
- **Instant Search Area Discovery (0ms Zero-Latency Pre-warm)**: Pre-populates discovery content, "Best for You" tracks, and AI recommendations immediately from disk/memory snapshot upon opening the app, eliminating the 5–10s search screen delay.

- **iPhone Companion App (`iosApp`) Updates**:
  - Added "Cached" tab in Library mirroring the 10-song offline cache.
  - Added "Best for You" discovery section in Search view.
- **Dual-Target GitHub Release Automation (Android APK + iPhone IPA)**:
  - Updated CI/CD workflow to compile both Android release APKs and iPhone IPAs directly on GitHub Actions.
  - Generates signed Android release APKs and universal sideloadable iPhone IPAs (ready for AltStore, SideStore, TrollStore, Scarlet, Sideloadly).
  - Automatically uploads all mobile assets to the GitHub Release.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- **Multi-Source Dynamic Recommendation Engine (OuterTune + Meld + EchoMusic Combo)**:
  - **OuterTune & InnerTune Automix Radio Seeds**: Automatically selects 1–2 random seeds from user playback history on each launch/refresh to explore fresh musical branches via YouTube Music's automix AI (`RDAMVM<seedId>`).
  - **EchoMusic Anti-History Deduplication**: Strictly excludes songs already played in recent listening history so recommendations always deliver brand-new discoveries rather than repetitive past tracks.
  - **Meld Spotify Hybridization**: Automatically blends top tracks and artist seeds from connected Spotify accounts into the discovery pool.
  - **Dynamic On-Refresh Shuffle**: Pull-to-refresh continuously re-rolls seed tracks for an ever-fresh, non-repeating discovery feed.
- **Account Backup Card with Live Size & Manual Trigger**: Displays total backup storage size badge (MB/KB) and a one-tap "Back Up Now" manual trigger in the User Accounts screen with live progress.
- **Artist Follow / Following & Block Controls**: Dedicated Follow and Block action buttons on artist profile headers with real-time state updates.
- **Automatic Spotify In-App Login & Token Capture**: Direct in-app Spotify WebView authentication that automatically captures tokens without manual copy-pasting.

### Fixed
- **Playlist Queue Disappearing & Infinite Single-Song Loop Bug**: Resolved issue where playing a playlist would suddenly drop all upcoming tracks and endlessly loop a single song in "listen again" mode. Ensured all playlist media items load synchronously into the playback engine and preserved timeline snapshots during dual-player transitions.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- **One-Tap Bulk Playlist Download**: Added a dedicated Download button to the top action bar of playlist screens, allowing users to queue and download all songs in a playlist in a single tap with live toast confirmation.
- **Curated Spotify Playlists & Top Songs ("Best Songs")**: Unlocked Spotify-curated playlists (e.g., "Best Songs of 2023/2024", "Discover Weekly", "Daily Mix") and automatically fetched user top tracks ("Your Top Songs (All-Time)" and "Your Top Songs (Recent / 2024-2025)") directly into the importable playlist list.
- **Direct Spotify Access Token & `sp_dc` Session Input**: Added a direct token/cookie input option in Spotify Settings allowing manual login using OAuth Access Tokens or Web Player `sp_dc` cookies.

### Fixed
- **Video Player Fullscreen Button Overlap**: Moved the in-artwork Fullscreen button to the bottom-right corner (`BottomEnd`), completely separating it from the top-bar video toggle button and eliminating misclicks.
- **Video Toggle Loading Spinner**: Live visual loading spinner on the full player video toggle button remains clearly visible throughout stream resolution and buffering.
- **Zero-Glitch Horizontal Video Fullscreen**: Replaced Activity-level orientation flipping with a stable full-screen landscape container, completely eliminating app twist, screen jitter, and portrait flip-back loops. Includes dedicated playback controls (play/pause, previous, next, quality picker, exit fullscreen).
- **Library Album "Not Found" & Wrong Album Resolution**: Resolved Navigation Compose path argument URL encoding issue for album IDs. Added composite metadata fallback (`album_meta|id|title|artist`) ensuring albums open their exact tracks reliably without failing or fetching unrelated albums.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-02
### Added
- **Constrained Square Artwork Video Player**: Inline video playback is strictly constrained within the square album cover boundaries without expanding vertically or obscuring bottom playback controls.

- **Landscape / Horizontal Fullscreen Mode**: Fullscreen video opens in true horizontal landscape orientation with full playback controls, scrub bar, and quality picker.
- **Home Release Radar (Last 30 Days)**: Replaced Moods with a dedicated Release Radar section featuring fresh releases from the last 30 days, sorted descending with exact release date badges ("Today", "Yesterday", "1 Sep", "30 Aug").
- **Instant Trending Search**: Pre-warmed search discovery displaying trending playlists and trending songs instantly without blank delay or cluttered artist bubbles.
- **Enhanced Song Recognition**: Added Cancel button while listening, instant playback handoff with sheet auto-dismiss, and Listen Again / Skip controls.

- **Spotify Web Player Token & `sp_dc` Cookie Authentication**: Seamless in-app WebView session capture and direct `sp_dc` cookie authentication bypassing Spotify 403 / 25-user Development Mode quotas.

## [0.10.9] - 2026-09-02
### Added
- **Social Reel & Video Audio Recognition**: Share Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts directly to VYBE to automatically analyze the background audio and recognize the exact song and matched timestamp offset (e.g., "Matched at 1:10").
- **Timestamp Offset Playback ("Play from Matched Time")**: Choose between "Play from beginning (0:00)" or "Play from matched timestamp (e.g. 1:10)" to jump straight to the viral reel chorus.
- **Ambient Recognition Auto-Dismiss & Player Handoff**: Tapping "Play in VYBE" on ambiently recognized songs or reel audio immediately dismisses the recognition sheet and opens the full player.

## [0.10.8] - 2026-09-02
### Added

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.22] - 2026-08-24
### Added
- **Artwork**: Added loading indicators when fetching album artwork.
### Fixed
- **Playback**: Fixed an issue where original metadata was overwritten.
- **Lyrics**: Fixed a network crash (400 Bad Request) when Lyrics Suggestions were turned off.
- **Sleep Timer**: Extracted Sleep Timer into its own dedicated menu button in the main player.
- **Recommendations**: Moods are now dynamically curated based on your listening habits.
- **Recommendations**: Blocked Artists now correctly filter out of generated daily mixes.
- **Search**: Improved typo-tolerance search ranking to heavily prioritize exact matches.
- **Settings**: Refined category icon colors for a richer, premium look.

## [0.7.21] - 2026-08-23
### Added
- **Search Enhancements**: YouTube Music search results are now cleanly categorized, with a dedicated section and tab just for "Videos", separating them from standard songs.
### Removed
- **UI Architecture**: Completely removed the experimental "Liquid Glass" App UI Style setting as it caused performance and layout issues. The app now strictly uses the polished Material UI.

## [0.7.20] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **Library Crash Fix**: Fixed a critical crash (`IllegalArgumentException: Key was already used`) that occurred when switching between tabs (like Folders/Albums) in the Library after playing music, which was caused by duplicate unique IDs in the listening history grid.

## [0.7.19] - 2026-08-23
### Changed
- **Onboarding Improvements**: Made critical permissions (Media, Notifications, and Battery Optimization) strictly mandatory. Users can no longer skip these during the initial setup, preventing unexpected crashes later. Optional preferences (Theme, Backup, Layouts) remain skippable.
### Fixed
- **Notification Fix**: Fixed an issue where tapping the media notification in the status bar would unnecessarily trigger the player sheet to slide open. It now correctly returns you to your previous state in the app without unwanted actions.

### Changed
- **UI Enhancements**: Upgraded the Playlist and Artist detail screens by replacing standard rectangular buttons with a sleek row of three floating action buttons (Play, Shuffle, Loop) shaped with `RoundedStarShape`.
### Fixed
- **App Launch/Setup Crash**: Fixed a critical race condition that caused the app to crash or freeze on many devices immediately after completing the onboarding setup. Navigation to the Home screen now safely waits for DataStore commits.
- **Release Stability**: Added comprehensive ProGuard and R8 rules to prevent aggressive code stripping for Hilt, Room DAOs, ExoPlayer/Media3, and WorkManager, which caused invisible crashes on fresh installs.
- **Sync Safety**: Wrapped initial library full sync in a safety block so that localized sync failures do not block app setup.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-08-23
### Added
- **Search History**: Added a Search History UI that displays previous search queries when the search bar is empty.
### Changed
- **Branding Updates**: Removed the old Beta clean-install disclaimer on startup. Replaced the Beta button in the top bar with "Smoothy Play" text.
### Fixed
- **Queue Deletion Crash**: Fixed a `NumberFormatException` crash when attempting to delete online songs from the queue by safely filtering non-local IDs.
- **Song Info Sheet**: Online songs no longer display the "Delete from device" option, preventing unsupported actions.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **Keystore Crash Fix**: Fixed crashes on devices with broken MasterKey/EncryptedSharedPreferences by safely falling back to standard SharedPreferences.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **Immersive UI Fix**: Fixed the visibility of the immersive artwork gradient behind the top action bar on album screens.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- Added release-safe recovery for legacy, incompatible, or corrupted local databases that could trap the app in an immediate startup crash loop.
- Added automatic recovery for a corrupted settings DataStore instead of crashing before the first screen appears.
- Release upgrades now rebuild only when local persistence cannot be opened safely; healthy databases and settings remain untouched.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- Existing installations now migrate safely from database version 42 instead of crashing during startup.
